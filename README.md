# School-Projects

This repo contains a few highlights of the projects I did during my undergrad degree at the U of M - TC.

CSCI 4131 was an internet programming course where we developed a fullstack web page complete with a database. 
We were given inital code for the database and CSS styling for the html pages but everything else including server and client
functionality was mostly my own coding.

CSCI 4611 was a computer graphics course so you'll find simple Typescript games that will run right in a browser tab. Again, we were provided
a large chunk of initial code in order to focus on learning the graphics.
