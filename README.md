# School-Projects

This repo contains a few highlights of the projects I did during my undergrad degree at the U of M - TC.

CSCI 4131 was an internet programming course where we developed a fullstack web page complete with a database.

CSCI 4611 was a computer graphics course so you'll find simple Typescript games that will run right in a browser tab.
