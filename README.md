# School-Projects

This repo contains a few highlights of the projects I did during my undergrad degree at the U of M - TC.

CSCI 4131 was an internet programming course where we developed a fullstack web page complete with a database. 
We were given inital code for the database and CSS styling for the html pages but everything else including server and client
functionality was mostly my own coding.

CSCI 3081 was our capstone class where we developed a front-end simulation of a drone-taxi simulation. There was much
more initial support code given to us as the focus of the class was in learning and refactoring existing code and implementing
design patterns such as strategy patterns in the ways the drone moved towards the robot. We also learned and utilized SCRUM and other common industry practices.

CSCI 4611 was a computer graphics course so you'll find simple Typescript games that will run right in a browser tab. Again, we were provided
a large chunk of initial code in order to focus on learning the graphics.
